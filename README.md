AWS–Powered Medical Data Integration and Mining for Improved Healthcare
</h1>

## 📝 Abstract

<div align="justify">

This project presents   PDFM (Privacy-free Data Fusion and Mining)  , a cloud-based application built on AWS for integrating and analyzing distributed medical data across healthcare systems. PDFM aims to support healthcare professionals by providing real-time access to multi-source medical information while preserving user privacy. The system uses four modules (Admin, Doctor, Patient, IOH) and securely stores medical data in AWS S3 buckets.

PDFM leverages the   Internet of Health (IoH)   paradigm and implements privacy-aware techniques like   Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)   to handle multi-source data mining and retrieval efficiently. The project is deployed on   AWS EC2  , ensuring scalable computation and secure data storage.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Enable secure, privacy-respecting integration of medical data across healthcare sources.
- Design and implement a scalable 4-module architecture (Admin, Doctor, Patient, IOH).
- Use   Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)   for multi-source data integration and privacy-preserving record search.
- Leverage   AWS S3   for secure, cost-effective storage.
- Enhance disaster diagnosis accuracy and clinical decision-making using real-time data.

## 🧪 Working Methodology

1. Clone the project
2. Run the full setup script (below)
3. Launch the Flask server
4. Connect to MySQL and AWS S3
5. Use browser to interact with all modules

---

## 🚀 Bash Setup Script

Save the below script as `setup.sh` and run it on Ubuntu:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update and install dependencies
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip mysql-server

# Install pip packages
pip3 install flask pandas numpy mysql-connector-python boto3

# Clone the repository (skip if already cloned)
# git clone https://github.com/Bharadwaj-1953/AWS-MedData.git
# cd AWS-MedData

# Set up MySQL service
sudo service mysql start

# Create database and user
echo "Creating MySQL database..."
mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE meddata_db;
  CREATE USER 'meduser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'medpass';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON meddata_db.* TO 'meduser'@'localhost';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"

# Show confirmation
echo "MySQL setup complete. Now configure DB connection in your Flask app."

# Export Flask environment variables
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development

# (Optional) Run Flask server
# flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000

echo "✅ Environment ready. Use 'flask run' to start the server."
```
To run it:
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Integrate AI-based disease prediction from uploaded symptoms
- Implement MFA (e.g., OTP verification)
- Add audit logging and analytics dashboard
- Extend support for real-time IoT health devices

---

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- Passwords hashed, sessions isolated per user type
- AWS S3 access via IAM roles and environment variables
- Database interactions sanitized to prevent SQL injection
